## Project Overview
As Lead Engineer, I delivered a **greenfield deployment of a secure campus network** for **SLIIT Northern UNI â€“ Jaffna**, enabling modern connectivity for students, staff, and academic resources.  

The deployment combined **advanced firewall segmentation, centralized wireless control, and high-availability switching**, ensuring a scalable and secure foundation for the universityâ€™s growing technology needs.  

---

## Business Challenges
- No existing secure infrastructure (greenfield site).  
- Requirement for **segregated student and staff access**.  
- Demand for **campus-wide wireless** with high availability.  
- Need for **redundant uplinks and scalable switching fabric**.  

---

## Solution Implemented
The solution leveraged Fortinet and HP/Aruba technologies to provide **security, reliability, and scalability**:  
- **FortiGate firewalls** with multi-zone segmentation (students, staff, guest).  
- **FortiAPs with centralized controller** for secure Wi-Fi across campus.  
- **HP & Aruba switches** with redundant uplinks and VLAN segmentation.  
- Secure VLAN design for **academic, admin, and guest networks**.  
- End-to-end monitoring and optimized traffic flow.

## Outcomes & Benefits
- **Secure multi-zone firewall architecture** for access separation.  
- **Campus-wide Wi-Fi** with centralized management.  
- **Role-based segmentation** between students, staff, and guests.  
- **High availability**
